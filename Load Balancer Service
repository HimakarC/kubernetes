**#To Create a Load Serive type....**

**<u>Step-1</u>:** Create an EKS Cluster with **eksctl**
--> **eksctl** provisions the entire EKS stack: **VPC, subnets, security groups, IAM roles, EC2 worker nodes and control plane.

**<u>Step-2</u>:** Associate IAM OIDC Provider
--> EKS uses IAM Roles for service Accounts (IRSA) to securely grant permissions to K8s pods.
--> This step enables your cluster to trust an OIDC identity provider, which is required for the AWS Load Balancer Controller to assume its IAM role.

**<u>Step-3</u>:** Create IAM Policy for Load Balancer Controller
--> The controller needs permissions to create and manage AWS resources like ALBs, Target Groups, Security Groups, etc.
--> This policy defines those permissions and is attached to the service account in the next step.

**<u>Step-4</u>:** Create IAM Service Account via **eksctl**
--> This creates a Kubernetes service account in the kube-system namespace and links it to the IAM policy.
--> The AWS Load Balancer Controller will use this account to interact with AWS APIs securely.

**<u>Step-5</u>:** Install AWS Load Balancer Controller via Helm
--> This installs the controller that translates Kubernetes Service and Ingress resources into AWS ALBs/NLBs.
